Air Hockey Game 

Directions for Playing:
1. When the page loads the game will automatically start
2. Use the WASD keys to move the "striker"
3. If the puck passes beyong either of the "strickers" then a point will be given to the
player who scored.
4. First to 7 wins
5. (if feature was implemented) The space bar does a power hit.

Helpful Tips:
- Slicing the puck puts more speed onto the puck which will help trick the AI to missing
- Since the AI is predicable some shots will repeat itself so try to pay attention to patterns
